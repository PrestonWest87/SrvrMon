## üê≥ Docker Instructions

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the root of the project directory (`server-monitor-docker/`) in your terminal and run:

```bash
docker build -t server-monitor-app .
```

This command builds a Docker image tagged as `server-monitor-app` using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

### Running the Docker Container

#### Basic Run

To run the container with default settings (2-second polling, monitoring container's root filesystem, and dummy logs generated by the application):

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name live-server-monitor --init server-monitor-app
```

  * `-d`: Run in detached mode (background).
  * `-p 5000:5000`: Map port 5000 of the host to port 5000 of the container (Flask app default port).
  * `--name live-server-monitor`: Assign a name to the container for easier management.
  * `--init`: Runs an init process as PID 1 in the container, which helps manage signals and zombie processes. Recommended for applications like this.

#### Running with Custom Configurations

You can customize the monitor's behavior using environment variables and Docker volume mounts:

**Environment Variables:**

  * `POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`: Data refresh interval in milliseconds (e.g., `1000` for 1 second, `5000` for 5 seconds). Default: `2000`. Minimum effective interval is around `500ms`.
  * `STORAGE_PATHS`: Comma-separated list of absolute paths *inside the container* to monitor for storage usage. Example: `STORAGE_PATHS="/,/mnt/data,/mnt/backups"`. If not set, defaults to `/host_root` if it exists, otherwise `/`.
  * `LOG_CONFIG`: Comma-separated list of `Name:Path` pairs for log files to monitor. `Name` is the display name in the UI, `Path` is the absolute path *inside the container*. Example: `LOG_CONFIG="Syslog:/var/log/syslog_host,App Log:/app/my_app_host.log"`. If not set, defaults to dummy logs created by the application.
  * `FLASK_DEBUG`: Set to `1` for Flask debug mode, `0` for production. Default is `0` as set in the `Dockerfile`. `run.py` uses this to toggle debug mode for `socketio.run`.
  * `FLASK_RUN_HOST`: Host for the Flask app. Default is `0.0.0.0` as set in `Dockerfile`.
  * `FLASK_RUN_PORT`: Port for the Flask app. Default is `5000` as set in `Dockerfile`.

**Volume Mounts (for monitoring host system resources):**

  * To monitor host storage, mount host directories into the container and specify the *container paths* in `STORAGE_PATHS`.
  * To monitor host log files, mount them into the container and specify the *container paths* in `LOG_CONFIG`.

**Example: Advanced Run Command**

This example runs the monitor with:

  * 3-second polling.
  * Monitors the host's root (`/`) and `/mnt/important_data` directories for storage.
  * Tails the host's `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/auth.log`.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
docker run -d \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    --name live-server-monitor \
    --init \
    -e POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=3000 \
    -e STORAGE_PATHS="/host_root,/host_data" \
    -e LOG_CONFIG="Host Syslog:/mnt/logs/syslog,Host Auth Log:/mnt/logs/auth.log" \
    -v /:/host_root:ro \
    -v /mnt/important_data:/host_data:ro \
    -v /var/log/syslog:/mnt/logs/syslog:ro \
    -v /var/log/auth.log:/mnt/logs/auth.log:ro \
    server-monitor-app
```

  * `:ro` makes the mounted volumes read-only from the container's perspective, which is recommended for monitoring to prevent accidental changes to host files.

### Accessing the Monitor

Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

`http://localhost:5000`

(If running Docker on a remote machine or VM, replace `localhost` with the machine's IP address).

-----

## üîß Customization & Modification

### Polling Interval

Set the `POLLING_INTERVAL_MS` environment variable during `docker run`.
Example: `-e POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=1000` for 1-second updates. The minimum effective interval is around `500ms` due to backend and frontend constraints.

### Monitored Storage

1.  Modify the `-v /host/path:/container/path:ro` Docker run option to mount the desired host storage directories.
2.  Set the `STORAGE_PATHS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of the *container paths* you've mapped.
    Example: `-v /data/drive1:/mnt/drive1_data:ro -e STORAGE_PATHS="/,/mnt/drive1_data"`

### Monitored Logs

1.  Modify the `-v /host/logfile.log:/container/logfile.log:ro` Docker run option to mount the desired host log files.
2.  Set the `LOG_CONFIG` environment variable.
    Example: `-v /var/log/my_app.log:/applogs/app.log:ro -e LOG_CONFIG="My Application Log:/applogs/app.log"`

### Frontend Styling & Appearance

  * **Tailwind CSS:** Styles are primarily managed using Tailwind CSS classes directly in `frontend/index.html`. You can modify these classes to change the appearance.
  * **Theme Colors:** Dark and light mode colors are defined using CSS custom properties (variables) in the `<style>` section of `frontend/index.html`. Adjust these variables (e.g., `--bg-color-primary`, `--text-color-accent`) to change the theme.
  * **Charts:** Chart appearance (colors, types) can be modified in the JavaScript section of `frontend/index.html`, specifically in the `createTimeSeriesChart` function and where charts are initialized.

### Backend Logic

  * **Data Collection (`backend/collectors.py`):** If you need to add new metrics or change how existing ones are collected, this is the primary file to modify. It uses the `psutil` library extensively.
  * **Application & WebSocket Handling (`backend/app.py`):** This file handles the Flask routes, Socket.IO events, and manages the background thread for emitting stats. Modifications here would be for changing API behavior or WebSocket communication. The `eventlet.monkey_patch()` is crucial and is called in `run.py`.

## üéÆ GPU Monitoring

### AMD GPU (Radeontop) Integration

The current `radeontop` integration is a basic placeholder that attempts to run `radeontop -l 1 -d -` and parse its text output.

To enable or improve it:

1.  **Install `radeontop` in Docker:** Ensure `radeontop` is included in the `apt-get install` command in your `Dockerfile`.
2.  **Device Access:** You'll likely need to pass AMD GPU devices to the container using `--device` flags during `docker run` (e.g., `--device=/dev/dri/card0 --device=/dev/kfd`). This can be hardware-specific.
3.  **Permissions:** The container might require elevated privileges or specific user group memberships to access GPU devices and `radeontop`.
4.  **Modify `backend/collectors.py`:**
      * Update the `get_radeontop_data()` function.
      * The current implementation uses `subprocess.run` to execute `radeontop` and includes a basic parser `parse_radeontop_single_line_output` for a specific output format. You might need to adjust the `radeontop` command options or the parsing logic (`parse_radeontop_single_line_output`) depending on your `radeontop` version and the desired metrics.
      * This is an advanced task and may require significant effort depending on the desired level of detail and compatibility with different `radeontop` versions.

### NVIDIA GPU Monitoring (Possibility)

Monitoring NVIDIA GPUs typically requires using NVIDIA's own tools, primarily `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA System Management Interface).

**Conceptual Steps to Add NVIDIA GPU Monitoring:**

1.  **NVIDIA Container Toolkit:** The host system and Docker need to be configured with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html). This allows Docker containers to access NVIDIA GPU resources.
2.  **Modify Dockerfile:**
      * It's generally better to use an NVIDIA-provided base image (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:tag-base`) as these come with necessary drivers and libraries.
      * If not using an NVIDIA base image, you would need to ensure `nvidia-smi` is accessible within the container, which might involve installing NVIDIA drivers and utilities. This is complex and error-prone; the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host is the preferred way as it makes GPUs available to standard containers.
3.  **Update `backend/collectors.py`:**
      * Create a new function, e.g., `get_nvidia_gpu_data()`.
      * Inside this function, use `subprocess.run` to execute `nvidia-smi` commands.
          * Example: `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=timestamp,name,temperature.gpu,utilization.gpu,utilization.memory,memory.total,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,noheader,nounits`
      * Parse the CSV output from `nvidia-smi`.
      * Structure the parsed data into a dictionary similar to other collectors.
4.  **Update `backend/app.py`:**
      * Call `get_nvidia_gpu_data()` within `get_all_stats()` and add its output to the `current_stats` dictionary.
5.  **Update `frontend/index.html`:**
      * Add new sections and/or charts to display NVIDIA GPU metrics.
      * Update the JavaScript to handle and render the new GPU data.
6.  **Docker Run Command:**
      * When running the Docker container, you'll need to include the `--gpus all` flag (or specify particular GPUs) if using the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
    <!-- end list -->
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name live-server-monitor --init --gpus all server-monitor-app
    ```

**Challenges:**

  * **NVIDIA Drivers & Toolkit:** Correct setup on the host is crucial.
  * **Parsing `nvidia-smi`:** While `nvidia-smi` offers CSV output, robust parsing is still needed.
  * **Container Privileges:** Ensuring the container has the right access if not using the NVIDIA Container Toolkit approach.

-----

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting

  * **Container not starting/exiting immediately:**

      * Check Docker logs: `docker logs live-server-monitor` (or your container name). Look for Python errors, issues with environment variables, or problems in `run.py` or `backend/app.py` during startup.
      * Ensure the `CMD` in your `Dockerfile` is correct (e.g., `CMD ["python", "run.py"]`).
      * Verify that `eventlet.monkey_patch()` is called at the very beginning of `run.py`.

  * **No data on webpage / "Connection Error" / "Disconnected":**

      * **Verify container is running:** `docker ps`. If not listed, check `docker ps -a` and then `docker logs <container_id_or_name>`.
      * **Check Docker logs for backend errors:** `docker logs live-server-monitor`. Pay attention to errors from `collectors.py` or `app.py`.
      * **Open browser's developer console (usually F12):**
          * Look for JavaScript errors in the "Console" tab.
          * Check the "Network" tab for WebSocket connection issues (often shown as pending or failing `socket.io` requests).
      * **Firewall:** Ensure no firewall is blocking port `5000` (or the port you've mapped) on the host or between your client machine and the Docker host.
      * **CORS Issues:** The backend `app.py` is configured with `cors_allowed_origins="*"`, which should generally prevent CORS issues. If you've modified this, ensure your frontend's origin is allowed.
      * **`POLLING_INTERVAL_MS` too low:** If set extremely low (e.g., below 100ms), it might overload the server or client. The application enforces a minimum of 500ms.

  * **Incorrect storage/log paths:**

      * **Double-check volume mounts (`-v`)**: Ensure the host path exists and the container path matches what's used in `STORAGE_PATHS` or `LOG_CONFIG`. Paths are case-sensitive.
      * **Check environment variables (`-e`)**: Verify `STORAGE_PATHS` and `LOG_CONFIG` are correctly formatted (comma-separated, `Name:Path` for logs).
      * **Permissions**: Ensure the user inside the Docker container (usually root, unless specified otherwise in `Dockerfile`) has read access to the mounted volumes. The `:ro` flag helps prevent writes but read access is still needed.
      * **Default Paths**: If environment variables are not set or invalid, the application defaults to `/host_root` or `/` for storage, and dummy logs for log files. Check `backend/app.py` logs for warnings about invalid configurations.

  * **Data not updating or updating erratically:**

      * Check `docker logs live-server-monitor` for errors in the `background_thread` in `backend/app.py` or within `get_all_stats` in `collectors.py`.
      * Ensure `socketio.sleep()` is used in the `background_thread` rather than `time.sleep()` for proper cooperative multitasking with `eventlet`. (This is correctly implemented in the provided `app.py`).

  * **CPU usage seems off or slow to update:**

      * `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.1)` is used. A very short interval can sometimes be less accurate or slightly delayed. The polling interval of the app itself (`POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`) is the main driver for UI updates.

  * **Network rates are zero or incorrect:**

      * The network rate calculation in `get_network_traffic` depends on the difference between two consecutive calls. The first data point will show 0 rates. Ensure the polling interval is not too short for meaningful deltas to be calculated.

  * **AMD GPU (Radeontop) section shows "Radeontop data not available" or error:**

      * **`radeontop` not installed:** Add `radeontop` to `apt-get install` in `Dockerfile`.
      * **Device not passed to container:** Use `--device=/dev/dri/cardX` and potentially `--device=/dev/kfd` with `docker run`.
      * **Permissions:** The container might need specific privileges.
      * **`radeontop` command or parsing error:** Check the status message and raw output sample in the UI. The `get_radeontop_data` function in `backend/collectors.py` captures errors. You might need to adjust the command or the `parse_radeontop_single_line_output` function if your `radeontop` version has different output.

  * **"Error creating dummy log" or "Error writing to or trimming dummy log":**

      * This usually indicates a permissions issue within the container for the path `/app/dummy_logX.log` or that the filesystem is read-only where it's trying to write. The default `Dockerfile` should allow this, but custom base images or security settings might interfere.
